title: "Multi-Leap: Multiple LeapMotion controllers on one machine"
---

{{< youtube X4LNkIV6XO8 >}}

Working demonstration of multiple
[[https://www.leapmotion.com/][LeapMotion]] infrared trackers being used
on one PC. This work was intended for an interactive projection surface,
and would allow multiple people to manually interact with applications
displayed on the glass.

This was achieved using
[[https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd-nspawn.html][SystemD-Nspawn]]
process containers in linux, as the Leap driver at the time did not
allow for multiple controllers to be connected to one machine. I used
the process isolation provided by SystemD to filter the USB identifiers
of the controllers in each container, so that only one controller was
seen per container instance. Since the Leap driver is exposed via
websocket, this allows for an application to use multiple controllers at
once.
