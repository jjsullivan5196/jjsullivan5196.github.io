This was the final deliverable for a computer architecture class. We were asked
to design an IOT product that would solve a specific problem, and the greatest
threat to any Monterey Bay student in 2018 was finding a parking spot on-time
for class.

We acknowledged the fact that all the university parking lots were in open-air
and had proximity to the school's WiFi. Therefore, we created an IOT-connected
sensor to detect open parking spaces, and report needed parking spaces to
students. This device only requires WiFi access points to operate, and can be
placed at the end of any parking spot.  All the software needed can be run in
on-demand compute services for a minimal cost. I ended up providing the IOT glue
for the device, the frontend webapp, and orchestrated the backend services to
demonstrate sending parking updates to students.
