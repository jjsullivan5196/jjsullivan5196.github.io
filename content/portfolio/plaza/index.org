Over the past few years, the Los Angeles Music Center has installed an IP camera
system and signboard monitors to create altered reflections of their plaza
space. yU+co has taken this system and used it to apply style-transferred
projections and other effects to those passing by.

I was contracted to provide a simple scheduling mediator for the different
effects used by the system, and allow for creating detailed schedules for the
week, by day, hour, scene and various controls for duration and immediate
scheduling. This allows the operators to control the central touchdesigner
application externally, and save persistent schedules that can be swapped for
different times of the year, all from a simple web application.
