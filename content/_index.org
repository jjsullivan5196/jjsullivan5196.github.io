* Welcome!
Hi, I'm John, and this is my site on the WWW. I'm a hacker by trade and hobby,
currently working as a freelancer. I love big cities, weird tech history, and
javascript. If you need someone with software design experience for a project, I
can help you get it done. Feel free to contact me about business, or my prior
work, via the contact info on this site or my resume.
