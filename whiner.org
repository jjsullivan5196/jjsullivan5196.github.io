#+TITLE: Righteous Indignation
#+DATE: <2024-07-15>

I'm just here to complain.

Technology makes our lives objectively worse, Uncle Ted already said
as much. Here I am, having given 28 years of my life to this trash,
and every economic force conspires to make me do more of it.

PFAs are in our blood, plastic lines the oceans, cobalt kills kids and
so does all the crispy carcinogens in burning motherboards. My
ancestors purportedly wasted their lives on a "dream" that their
children would never attain. Who is free today? Who is truly free?

It is hard to care anymore.
