<p>Roy Fielding&rsquo;s disseration on the design of networked applications and RESTful

the web and applications we build on top of it.</p>

</ul>
<p>REPLs aren&rsquo;t just about evaluating code interactively, they&rsquo;re a well-defined
entrypoint for the programmer to modify and inspect a system. The ceremony is
well-organized and specifically tailored to this purpose, you send data to the
program, the program evaluates it, and you get data back. Also see the linked
talk by Nada Amin, which evaluates this concept from the perspective of
implementing languages.</p>

<p>Cosmo is a gargantuan effort to create a C library that can target multiple
platforms at once in a single binary. It has one abstraction over the system
layer that largely emulates the amd64 ABI for Linux, meaning that most
applications made for Linux can run natively on any major operating system. It
also bundles necessary functions for common tasks like HTTP servers or
multimedia manipulation. Redbean is a small application server linked against
cosmo that provides the equivalent of a full LAMP stack in one program, one
executable file that is your entire application, with its code and database state.</p>

<p>Forth is a very small programming language, phrased more as an abstract stack
machine. The machine executes words, which are procedures that manipulate data
on a shared stack. Typically the machine is defined in terms of primitive words,
implemented in native machine code. Forth metacompilers allow for this abstract
machine to be defined in Forth itself, creating a very tight loop for designing
other Forth systems.</p>

<h1 id="my-bad-ill-advised-opinions">My bad, ill-advised opinions</h1>
<p>This article is an annotated reading list that tracks tools for better
understanding how software is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">made</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">run</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">machines</a>. It will be
loaded with a lot of my own wacky opinions of how bad software and computers
are, since it is my main motivation for constantly looking for more of these
materials.</p>
<p>More specifically, I want to understand why the engineering distance between a
machine and the practical applications it performs is so inordinately large. We
have excellent, high-level programming languages with appropriate primitives to
build world-scale systems, but God forbid you want to talk to a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Overv/7ac07356037592a121225172d7d78f2d">graphics</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/_36yNWw_07g?si=ne3IAwWmQEcEk6e3">device</a> and have it do a cool
trick you just thought up, or create your own <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html">programming
language</a>, or any number of
applications that involve negotiating with some platform.</p>
<p>Smalltalk, all the way back in the 1980s, did solve all the problems related to
bootstrapping a complete programming system from bare metal, and you could
inspect any layer of that solution with the same exact tools you use to write
applications. Why can&rsquo;t we do that today? Why can&rsquo;t we create a closed
abstraction of a machine that any platform or language can use?</p>
<p>I lay the blame with our development tools being inadequate for understanding a
complete system as a whole, from hardware &amp; platforms to the software that runs
on them. Any programmer should be able to spend an afternoon in any programming
language and be able to have a small kernel program that can file your taxes and
send HTTP requests on nearly anything that can run code. However, we often get
stuck in what is the right language not for the application we are making, but
rather how this language can eventually target some CPU, operating system, VM
hypervisor, container framework, web browser, game console, and so on. Even when
you do have merely adequate tools for development, they often grow legs and run
far away from your language of choice, ask you to suffer hours of tutorials or
documentation that doesn&rsquo;t generalize, or bring <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs">all their 50+ year old
friends</a> to give you some light reading.</p>
<p>Considering our platform is a fine problem to have, but in the end it shouldn&rsquo;t
be something that restricts our ability to use the right tool for the problem
we&rsquo;re trying to solve. Platforms offer us primitives to run code, languages
arrange those primitives into useful tools for solving problems. Programming
languages should offer us the ability to solve both our application and
platform-related problems in a generic way. Despite this, we settle for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better">worse
is better</a> and have bespoke,
cryptic and non-portable solutions for abstracting over platforms. See the
demand for win32 emulation, Valve basically adopting the WINE project, the C
programming language being unable to die, and the success of Docker for evidence
of platforms being more than platforms.</p>
<p>Even the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">conceptual</a>
<a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">machines</a> we build on top of the
real ones don&rsquo;t make our programs easier to comprehend. Often they ignore
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)">years</a> of research
work, or they haphazardly cherry pick features for some particular reason (often
not good reasons) to the
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction">detriment</a>
of the overall system being transparent to the person who works with it.</p>
<p>I enjoy masochistically pretending I can do something about all of this, so I
spend a lot of time messing with compilers and other such tools to see how we
can simplify the process of making great applications. This list documents some
of the resources I&rsquo;ve collected to gain some insight on this issue and prior
attempts at making better tools for software development.</p>
