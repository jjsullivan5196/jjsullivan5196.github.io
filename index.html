Hi, I'm John, and this is my website.

This will be the record of my

concluding in some approximation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth">what is</a>, or a permanent

The <a href="https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/">Techno-Optimist</a> is quite the conflicted character, somehow being a
superposition of <a href="https://geohot.github.io/blog/jekyll/update/2023/04/11/wireheading-city.html">enlighted philanthropists</a>, venture capital
golddiggers, <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos">self-aggrandizing memers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace#Insight_into_potential_of_computing_devices">Ada Lovelace</a> and <a href="https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/">Bertrand
Russell</a>. Simultaneously a champion for progress, not in the here and
now, but also not one of those thousand yard stare <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruists</a>
you keep hearing about. Here in the land of optimistic outlook, the
techno-capital machine creates no pollution, lets the market be free,
and manifests post-scarcity levels of abundance. Also, criticism is
for losers, <a href="https://graymirror.substack.com/p/heroin-liberals-and-cocaine-conservatives">smoke some crack or something.</a>

inherent contradictions. Stronger forms descend of their ancestors, rid

This article is an annotated reading list that tracks tools for better
understanding how software is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">made</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">run</a> on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture">machines</a>. It
will be loaded with a lot of my own wacky opinions of how bad software
and computers are, since it is my main motivation for constantly
looking for more of these materials.
</p>

<p>
More specifically, I want to understand why the engineering distance
between a machine and the practical applications it performs is so
inordinately large. We have excellent, high-level programming
languages with appropriate primitives to build world-scale systems,
but God forbid you want to talk to a
<a href="https://gist.github.com/Overv/7ac07356037592a121225172d7d78f2d">graphics</a>
<a href="https://youtu.be/_36yNWw_07g?si=ne3IAwWmQEcEk6e3">device</a> and have
it do a cool trick you just thought up, or create your own
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html">programming language</a>,
or any number of applications that involve negotiating with some
platform.
</p>

<p>
Smalltalk, all the way back in the 1980s, did solve all the problems
related to bootstrapping a complete programming system from bare
metal, and you could inspect any layer of that solution with the same
exact tools you use to write applications. Why can't we do that today?
Why can't we create a closed abstraction of a machine that any
platform or language can use?
</p>

<p>
I lay the blame with our development tools being inadequate for
understanding a complete system as a whole, from hardware &amp; platforms
to the software that runs on them. Any programmer should be able to
spend an afternoon in any programming language and be able to have a
small kernel program that can file your taxes and send HTTP requests
on nearly anything that can run code. However, we often get stuck in
what is the right language not for the application we are making, but
rather how this language can eventually target some CPU, operating
system, VM hypervisor, container framework, web browser, game console,
and so on.  Even when you do have merely adequate tools for
development, they often grow legs and run far away from your language
of choice, ask you to suffer hours of tutorials or documentation that
doesn't generalize, or bring
<a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs">all their 50+ year old
friends</a> to give you some light reading.
</p>

<p>
Considering our platform is a fine problem to have, but in the end it
