A poster I co-authored demonstrating a novel gesture sensor, built from
an array of bend resistors.

I implemented a recognizer using a Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent
Neural Network, it achieved accuracy surpassing the competing Myo sensor
for the same set of gestures. I also wrote drivers for the sensor itself
using the Arudino toolkit and python serial IO libraries.
