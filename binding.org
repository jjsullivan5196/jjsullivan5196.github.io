#+BEGIN_VERSE
There is only one impossible problem: naming things

What greater form of violence is there, than to create concretions of identity

To know the composition of yourself and the world you inhabit

Such depth, suffocated by the shallow puddle of symbol and shorthand

Freedom and purpose, truncated for comfort
